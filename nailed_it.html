	  		<h1>Some Context</h1>
	  		<p class="lead"> In February 2019, a group of three friends and I entered the HackXplore Health hackathon hosted by TechXplore UofT. The challenge of the hackathon was left wide open, allowing any software that could be implemented in hospitals and/or used in the medical industry to be eligible.</p>

				<h1>You have 24 hours, Go!</h1>
				<p class="lead">The hackathon officially began at 8pm and ended the following night. The team, faced with a plethora of opportunities, spent the next 2 hours brainstorming viable, not to mention feasible, software we could develop. In the spur of all this madness, I noticed myself looking down at my fingernails, which habitually picked at their neighbouring fingers. I remembered learning that fingernails are surprisingly capable indicators of general health. This proposed a rather innocent question to the team of four,  “Do  you  guys think my fingernails are healthy” which further evolved into, “What information about our general health can we deduce from our fingernails”.

	<h1>Get Nailed? … How about Nailed it? … that’s better</h1>
	<p class="lead">After some rather immature naming schemes were bounced around, the group settled on a more suitable name, “Nailed It”.</p>

			<h1>How does it work?</h1>
			<p class="lead">The app uses open-source AI Tensorflow and Python to perform early-stage diagnosis of anemia, illnesses stemmed from oxygen deprivation, and various infections by analyzing the discrepancy between a user's skin and nail colours.  Once a user uploads a picture of their fingernail, we use AI finger recognition to key into the specific pixels pertaining to the nail and hand. Using Python, the picture is then analyzed pixel by pixel and compared to the skin color of the patients hand. Using extensive open-source databases on nail discoloration the amount of discolouration was quantifiable and  more importantly, comparable. We divided discolouration into three potential causes: anemia, oxygen deprivation, and fungal infections.</p>
